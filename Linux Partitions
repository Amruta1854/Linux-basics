1. Open a terminal window (select Applications > Accessories > Terminal). 
   Switch to the root user use the sudo command:
   $ sudo fdisk -l
   
2. If no devices are given, those mentioned in /proc/partitions (if that exists) are used. 
   You can specify device name as follows (in this example list partitions for /dev/sda):
   # fdisk -l   
   
3. The sfdisk command act as a partition table manipulator for Linux. You can use this tool to list partitions too:
   # sfdisk -l /dev/sda
   # sfdisk -lu /dev/sda
   # sfdisk -ls /dev/sda   
   
   Where,
   -l : List the partitions of a device.
   -s : List the size of a partition.
   -u or -uS or -uB or -uC or -uM : Accept or report in units of sectors (blocks, cylinders, megabytes, respecpively). 
                                    The default is cylinders, at least when the geometry is known   
 
4. Listing Linux a Partition Size Larger Than 2TB
   The fdisk or sfdisk command will not list any partition size larger than 2TB. 
   To solve this problem you need to use GNU parted command with GPT partitions. It supports Intel EFI/GPT partition tables.
   EFI uses GPT where BIOS uses a Master Boot Record (MBR). In this example list partitions on /dev/sdb using the parted command:
   # parted /dev/sdb
   
5. GNU/Linux parted prompt:
   GNU Parted 3.3
   Using /dev/sdb
   Welcome to GNU Parted! Type 'help' to view a list of commands.
   (parted)
   
6. Set unit type to TB or GB by typing ‘unit TB‘ or ‘unit GB‘ at the (parted) prompt:
   (parted) unit TB
   OR
   (parted) unit GB

7. To list partitions type print command at the (parted) prompt:
   (parted) print  
   
8. To exit from parted session type ‘quit’ at the (parted) prompt:
   (parted) quit

9. Pass the -l OR –list option to the parted command to lists partition layout on all block devices:
   # parted -l   
   
10.Use the lsscsi command to show SCSI devices (or hosts) and their attributes:
   # lsscsi 
   
11.We can use the hwinfo command to probe for hardware as follows:
   hwinfo | more
   hwinfo --block | more
   hwinfo --block --short
   inxi -P
   inxi -p | more
   
12.blog post and man pages by typing the following man command:
   man fdisk
   man lsblk
   man sfdisk
   man parted
