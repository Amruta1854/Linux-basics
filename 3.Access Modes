#Every file in Unix has the following attributes :

       1)Owner permissions − The owner's permissions determine what actions the owner of the file can perform on the file.

       2)Group permissions − The group's permissions determine what actions a user, who is a member of the group that a file belongs to, can perform on the file.

       3)Other (world) permissions − The permissions for others indicate what action all other users can perform on the file.

ls -l -> it displays various information related to file permission 

#The permissions are broken into groups of threes, and each position in the group denotes a specific permission, in this order: read (r), write (w), execute (x) :

       1)The first three characters (2-4) represent the permissions for the file's owner. For example, -rwxr-xr-- represents that the owner has read (r), write (w) and execute (x) permission.

       2)The second group of three characters (5-7) consists of the permissions for the group to which the file belongs. For example, -rwxr-xr-- represents that the group has read (r) and execute (x) permission, but no write permission.

       3)The last group of three characters (8-10) represents the permissions for everyone else. For example, -rwxr-xr-- represents that there is read (r) only permission.

#File Access Modes :
The permissions of a file are the first line of defense in the security of a Unix system. The basic building blocks of Unix permissions are the read, write, and execute permissions, which have been described below :

       1)Read (4) : Grants the capability to read, i.e., view the contents of the file.

       2)Write (2) : Grants the capability to modify, or remove the content of the file.

       3)Execute (1): User with execute permissions can run a file as a program.
       
#Changing Permissions :
chmod -> To change the file or the directory permissions 

#Using chmod with Absolute Permissions :

	No permission	                    ---
	Execute permission	            --x
	Write permission	            -w-
	Execute and write permission:       -wx
         1 (e) + 2 (w) = 3	
	Read permission	                    r--
	Read and execute permission:        r-x
         4 (r) + 1 (e) = 5	
	Read and write permission:          rw-
         4 (r) + 2 (w) = 6	
	All permissions:                    rwx 
         4 (r) + 2 (w) + 1 (e) = 7	

#Changing Owners and Groups :
While creating an account on Unix, it assigns a owner ID and a group ID to each user. All the permissions mentioned above are also assigned based on the Owner and the Groups.

chown −> The chown command stands for "change owner" and is used to change the owner of a file.

chgrp −> The chgrp command stands for "change group" and is used to change the group of a file.
