Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is a security architecture for Linux systems that allows administrators to have more control over who can access the system. 

It was originally developed by the United States National Security Agency (NSA) as a series of patches to the Linux kernel using Linux Security Modules (LSM). 

It acts as protective agent on servers.

SELinux is the security implementation which enhances system security and in the event of security breach, it stops that from spreading in entire system.

If SELinux is enabled, hackers will not be able to access the other services available on sever as well as they will not be able to write anything in /tmp or /var/tmp directory.

#Mode of SeLinux :
SELinux works in three modes; Disable, Permissive and Enforcing. In disable mode SELinux remains completely disable. If SELinux is enabled, it will be in either Permissive mode or in Enforcing mode.
In permissive mode SELinux will only monitor the interaction. In enforcing mode SELinux will also filter the interaction with monitoring.

1) Enforcing  - Enforcing mode is the default mode at installation of SELinux. It will enforce the policies on the system, deny access and log actions.
2) Permissive - Permissive mode is the most commonly used mode for troubleshooting SELinux. In this mode, SELinux enables but does not enforce security policies. Also, this means that actions will result in a warning and log for the system administrator.
3) Disabled   - Disabled mode means that SELinux is turned off and the security policies do not protect the server.

#SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
        enforcing  - SELinux security policy is enforced.
        permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
        disabled   - No SELinux policy is loaded.

#SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
       targeted - Targeted processes are protected,
       mls      - Multi Level Security protection.
